# 🧠 Trove Digital Nexus

Welcome to the **Trove Digital Nexus**, the official digital headquarters of **The Trove** — a tech collective and creative community built for coders, designers, media makers, and visionaries. This platform serves as our public-facing showcase, internal dashboard, and launchpad for all things tech, media, and culture.

## ⚡ Vision

> "The Trove is more than a tech group — it’s a movement. A rebellion. A renaissance of black creativity, skill, and structure."

This React-based frontend captures that vision through bold design, modular components, and a focus on showcasing our 4 main pillars:

1. 🧱 Host Website (This platform)
2. 🎞️ Media Content
3. 🛠️ Software Projects
4. 📢 Tech Conventions
